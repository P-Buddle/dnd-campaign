                As you flee North – you spot an old chest on the bottom of a dried up river bed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Opening it, you find a series of objects (including half of a magic amulet) and a map.
            </p>
            <p>
                Deciding to follow the map, you find the entrance to a series of underground chambers, carefully concealed within a boulder.
            </p>
            <p>
                The architecture appears ancient, and elegant beyond the likes of which you have ever seen. A series of carvings reveal that this is perhaps part of the remnants of a great civilization.
            </p>
            <p>
                After passing through several methods of security you find your way into a vast hall, dissected by a huge crack in the ground. The rift emanates a peculiar sensation – somewhere between a sound and a smell, a tangy metallic taste at the back of the throat. Sensory confusion.
            </p>

            <p>
                You do battle with a titan like stone creature, who seems to be guarding the second half of the amulet, which you find within a chest in the centre of the hall.

            </p>
            <p>
                The purpose of the amulet remains ambiguous, but it through Thex's arcane studies into the amulet, and Castors ability to detect magic, you realise that this object is more powerful than anything you have ever come across.
